\title{A function for fitting various ppms using a ppmData data object}
\usage{
ppmFit(
  species_formula = presence/weights ~ 1,
  bias_formula = NULL,
  ppmdata,
  method = c("lasso", "glm", "gam", "ridge", "ppmlasso"),
  control = list(n.fit = 20),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_formula}{The ppm model formula for the environmental/niche relationships. What drives the distribution of the species?}

\item{bias_formula}{Default is NULL. The idea will be to implement this as part of an integrated model.
Currently its just a nice way to keep track of which covariates are used in species or bias variables.
If you include this formula at the moment it will be merged into the species formula and used additively in a loglinear equation}

\item{ppmdata}{A ppmData data object}

\item{method}{A method to fit the a ppm. Default is 'lasso'. Others options are: 'glm','gam','lasso','ridge' - removed ppmlasso for now}

\item{control}{Options to pass to fitting functions.}

\item{\\dots}{Other things, not really used.}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function which will fit a ppm model using a range of existing fitting tools.
